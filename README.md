| **[PROG](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/PROG)** | Representing and processing RGB color images using C++, with each RGB channel allocated 8 bits. |
| **[AED_1](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/AED_1)** | Manage school schedules, allowing the manipulation of information related to students, classes, curricular units (UCs), and schedule change requests. |
| **[AED_2](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/AED_2)** | Models a network of flights and airports using a graph structure. |
| **[BD](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/BD)** | A database system for managing a transport company, handling data on companies, warehouses, vehicles, employees, and customer orders, enabling efficient operation tracking and management. |
| **[LDTS](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/LDTS)** | Players control a spaceship to avoid meteors, destroy enemy ships, and collect power-ups. The goal is to achieve the highest score before the ship's health reaches zero. |
| **[LCOM](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/LCOM)** | *Last One Standing* is a game inspired by the Discord game Land-io. Players compete to expand their territory and outlast opponents, aiming to be the last player remaining on the map. |
| **[DA_1](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/DA_1)** | A system that manages the water supply using graphs to model and analyze the network of cities, reservoirs, and pumping stations. |
| **[DA_2](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/DA_2)** | A system that solves the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) using various algorithms and heuristics, applying them to graph structures representing distances between cities or points of interest. |
| **[ESOF](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/ESOF)** | A mobile app that simplifies food management by tracking your groceries, notifying you when items are low or past their sell-by date. Easily add or update products, categorize them, and secure the app with a password for privacy. |
| **[LTW](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/LTW)** | A website that facilitates the buying and selling of pre-loved items. |
| **[IPC](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/IPC)** | *Wattopia*, an energy-focused application prototype that combines education, gamification, and community engagement to encourage sustainable energy practices. |
| **[LBAW](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/LBAW)** | *Planora*, a project management system that enables task assignment, deadline tracking, team organization, and collaborative feedback through comments and role-based permissions. |
| **[PFL](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/PFL)** | Developed two projects: in Haskell, solving graph optimization problems such as the Shortest Path and Traveling Salesman Problem; and in Prolog, implementing *Blackstone*, a two-player board game with multiple modes, rule variants, and difficulty levels. |
| **[RCOM_1](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/RCOM_1)** | Implemented a reliable file transfer protocol over a serial connection, featuring error detection, retransmission, and flow control to ensure data integrity. |
| **[RCOM_2](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/RCOM_2)** | Developed a client-server application using sockets to perform reliable file transfers, exploring TCP/UDP communication, error handling, and performance optimization. |
| **[COMP](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/COMP)** | Built a compiler for the Java-- language, featuring lexical/syntactic/semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, JVM bytecode translation, and optimizations like register allocation, constant propagation, and constant folding. |
| **[CG](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/CG)** | Created an interactive 3D scene where a helicopter takes off from a fire station, flies over a procedurally generated forest, collects water from a lake, and extinguishes fires, with shaders and animations adding realism and immersion. |
| **PI** | Developed an AR application for Apple Vision Pro where users can explore offshore windfarms on an interactive globe, visualize 3D turbines reacting to real-time weather data, and experience dynamic effects like wind and rain. |
| **[IA_1](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/IA_1)** | Implemented metaheuristic algorithms (Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, and Genetic Algorithms) to solve the Stock Portfolio Optimization problem, comparing their performance through a GUI with visualizations and results export. |
| **[IA_2](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/IA_2)** | Built and compared supervised learning models (k-NN, SVM, Decision Tree, and a stacked Autoencoder with CNN+GRU) for binary classification of software defects, with full EDA, preprocessing, evaluation metrics, and visualizations. |
| **[CPD_1](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/CPD_1)** | Analyzed matrix multiplication algorithms (Simple, LineÃ—Line, Block) in C/C++ and Java, evaluating performance with cache metrics, MFLOPS, and parallelization techniques to measure speedup and efficiency. |
| **[CPD_2](https://github.com/RuiCruz16/CPD_2)** | Developed a secure distributed chat application with user authentication, dynamic room management, SSL/TLS communication, and integration with Language Learning Models (LLMs) for interactive conversations. |
